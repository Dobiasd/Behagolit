Behagolit
=========
**a toy programming language experiment**

Etymology:
- "Behag" comes from the German [behaglich](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/behaglich), meaning comfortable, cosy.
- "olit" is the second-person singular past indicative of the Finish [olla](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/olit), which means "to be.
So Behagolit could resemble something like "you were comfortable". (And maybe using Behagolit is the reason you now no longer are comfortable. ^_-)

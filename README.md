Behagolit
=========
**a toy programming language experiment**

## Philosophy

- [Ubiquefix notation](Ubiquefix.md)
- Functions are first-class values.
- Expressions are evaluated lazily.
- Everything is an expression. Definitions are immutable.
- The potential side effects of a function are reflected in its type.

## Etymology

- "Behag" comes from the German [behaglich](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/behaglich), meaning comfortable, cosy.
- "olit" is the second-person singular past indicative of the Finish [olla](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/olit), which
  means "to be".

So Behagolit could resemble something like "you were comfortable". (And maybe using Behagolit is the reason you now are in a different condition. ^_-)
